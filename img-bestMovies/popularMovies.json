      "plot": "Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by James Cameron. He co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role.[6] New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, and Jemaine Clement. In the film, Na'vi Jake Sully (Worthington) and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the Metkayina clan of Pandora. Cameron stated in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it was successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the necessity to develop new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.[2][3] After repeated delays in the expected release schedule, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered in London on December 6, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16, 2022. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.[10] The film was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing about $2.131 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film of the COVID-19 pandemic era, and the fourth highest-grossing film of all time. Organizations like the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named it as one of the top ten films of 2022. The film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and received numerous other accolades."

      "plot": "Babylon is a 2022 American epic period comedy drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle. It features an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jean Smart, Jovan Adepo and Li Jun Li. It chronicles the rise and fall of multiple characters during Hollywood's transition from silent to sound films in the late 1920s. Chazelle began developing the film in July 2019, with Lionsgate as the frontrunner to acquire the project. It was announced that Paramount Pictures had acquired worldwide rights in November 2019. Much of the main cast joined the project between January 2020 and August 2021, and filming took place in Los Angeles from July to October 2021. Babylon premiered at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Los Angeles on November 14, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 23. The film polarized critics, who generally praised its cinematography, score, production design and lead performances, but were sharply divided on its direction, screenplay, graphic content, and runtime. It was a box-office bomb, grossing $42 million against a production budget of $78–80 million.[6] The film received five nominations at the 80th Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, winning Best Original Score), nine nominations at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards (including Best Picture), three nominations at the 76th British Academy Film Awards, and three nominations at the 95th Academy Awards."

      "plot": "Everything Everywhere All at Once is a 2022 American absurdist comedy-drama film written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively known as the 'Daniels'), who produced it with Anthony and Joe Russo. The plot centers on a Chinese-American immigrant (played by Michelle Yeoh) who, while being audited by the IRS, discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from destroying the multiverse. Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis appear in supporting roles. The New York Times called the film a 'swirl of genre anarchy' with elements of surreal comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts films, and animation.[6] Kwan and Scheinert began work on the project in 2010, and its production was announced in 2018. Principal photography ran from January to March 2020. The soundtrack features compositions by Son Lux, including collaborations with Mitski, David Byrne, André 3000, John Hampson and Randy Newman. Everything Everywhere All at Once premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2022, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 25, 2022, before a wide release by A24 on April 8, 2022. It was a commercial success and grossed about $106 million worldwide, becoming A24's first film to cross the $100 million mark and surpassing Hereditary (2018) as its highest-grossing film. The film has received near-universal acclaim for its portrayal of philosophical concepts such as existentialism, nihilism, and absurdism, as well as other themes including generational trauma, ADHD, and Asian-American identity. The movie's accolades include being named a top-ten film of 2022 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute; two Golden Globes for Yeoh and Quan at the 80th Golden Globe Awards from 6 nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Director; five awards from a leading 14 nominations at the 28th Critics' Choice Awards, including Best Picture; five nominations at the 29th Screen Actors Guild Awards, including acting nominations for the overall ensemble and individual nominations for Yeoh, Quan, Hsu, and Curtis; 10 nominations at the 76th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film; and 11 nominations at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, becoming the most nominated film of the ceremony."

M3GAN premiered in Los Angeles on December 7, 2022, and was released in the United States on January 6, 2023, by Universal Pictures. The film was a commercial and critical success, grossing over $150 million worldwide against a budget of $12 million and receiving praise from critics for its campy blend of horror and humor, satirical elements, and performances. A sequel, titled M3GAN 2.0, is scheduled to be released on January 17, 2025, with Williams and McGraw reprising their roles and Cooper returning to write the script."
